# Election_Analysis-
Module 3 in CU BootCamp 

## Adding few modifications to the code 

 **Dynamic approach:** We need to make sure that the code is as abstract as possible so it could be used with any election data file. I would suggest making it easier for the user by adding to the code the following:
- Give the user the ability to drag and drop the election file.
- Generate analysis file based on the file that the user has dragged.

# Election_Analysis-
Module 3 in CU BootCamp 

## Project Overview 
In this project, we are going to assist a Colorado Board of Elections employee, Tom, to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election. To do that we need to do the following tasks: 

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
3. Determine the county with the largest number of votes (the highest turnout).
4. Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
5. Determine the winner of the election, their vote count, and their percentage of the total votes.

### Purpose 
The aim of this work is to provide evidence to Tom's manager that there's a way to automate the process of the audit using Python instead of Excel. This will help them in the audit of other congressional districts, senatorial districts and local elections. 

## Resources 
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.8.5, Visual Studio 1.69.1  

## Analysis of Data 

The first major piece of our code (showed below) is to create file paths, to external files, across operating systems. To be able to do that we should import os module and csv module using ```import os``` and ```import csv```. 

- After that, we have created 2 paths. 
	- One to open the election results data file "election_results.csv" which is saved in the "Resources" folder: <br /> 
```file_to_load = os.path.join("Resources", "election_results.csv")```
	- One to save the results of our audit in a text file named "election_analysis.txt" saved in the "Analysis" folder: <br />
```file_to_save = os.path.join("analysis", "election_analysis.txt")```

- We used the ```with()``` statements to open the election results and analysis files.
 
- Inside the ```with()``` statement we have used  repetition statements and conditional statements with logical operators  to be able to find answers to our task. 

- Finally, we have used print statements ```txt_file.write()```
 to print out the candidate and county election results to the command line.

 **The final code is shown below:**

## Election-Audit Results
When we run the code the candidate and county election results were printed in the terminal (See Fig.1) as well as in the "election_analysis.txt‚Äù that we have already created (See Fig.2).

    - Diana DeGette, who received "73.8%" of the votes and "272,892" number of votes.


## Election-Audit Summary    
The analysis of the election data with Python allows us to complete the election audit successfully. Thus, we can say that automating the process of the audit using Python should be taken into consideration. 

However, I would suggest few modifications to the code in order to be more efficient for any election.  
 
1. Abstraction: We need to make sure that the code is as abstract as possible so it could be used with any election data file. I would suggest make it easier for the user by writing a code allowing the user to drag and drop the election data file.

2. Visualize the data: Data visualization will help in understanding the results in an easier and faster way. If we have more data (more candidates and county), it will take more than 10 minutes for us to read who won the election. While if we use a bar graph, per examples, in our output results it will take us few seconds to spot the highest bar and the name of the winner candidate.
